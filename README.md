# Taxi-Treasures

Welcome to Taxi-Treasures! This web app provides a platform for connecting people who have lost or found items inside taxi cabs. Whether you accidentally left something behind or discovered an item left by someone else, Taxi-Treasures allows you to publish and search for lost and found items. Through this app, users can communicate with each other and arrange the return of lost belongings.

## Features

- **Publish Lost Items**: If you have lost something inside a taxi cab, you can publish the details of the lost item using Taxi-Treasures. This includes providing a description, relevant information, and contact details.

- **Publish Found Items**: If you find an item in a taxi cab, you can publish its details on Taxi-Treasures. By doing so, you enable the person who lost the item to find it and contact you for its retrieval.

- **User Communication**: Taxi-Treasures facilitates communication between the person who has lost an item and the person who found it. Users can exchange messages securely within the app to coordinate the return of lost belongings.

- **Token-based Security**: To ensure the security of user accounts, Taxi-Treasures implements token-based authentication. Once users log in, they receive a token that they can use to access and interact with the app's features.

- **Email Integration**: Taxi-Treasures leverages the power of mailJS technology to enable email communication between users. This ensures that users can easily reach out to each other and exchange information about lost and found items.
